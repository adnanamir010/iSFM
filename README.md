### Robust Incremental Structure-from-Motion

![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-green)![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11%2B-blue)![C++ Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-17-purple)

This repository contains the development of a hybrid, incremental Structure-from-Motion (SfM) system. The goal is to create a robust 3D reconstruction pipeline that leverages not only traditional point features but also lines and vanishing points to achieve superior performance, especially in challenging, weakly-textured indoor environments.

This project is an implementation and exploration of the concepts presented in the paper **"Robust Incremental Structure-from-Motion with Hybrid Features"** by Liu et al.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Hybrid Feature Integration:** Natively handles points, lines, and vanishing points (VPs) for a richer scene representation.
- **Incremental Processing:** Builds the 3D reconstruction frame-by-frame, suitable for real-time applications.
- **Robust Estimation:** Designed to overcome the limitations of traditional point-based SfM in poorly-textured scenes.
- **Uncertainty Propagation:** Models and propagates uncertainty for more reliable tracking and mapping.
- **C++/Python Architecture:** Combines high-performance C++ for core algorithms with a user-friendly Python API.
- **CUDA Accelerated:** Leverages NVIDIA GPUs for performance-critical operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

This project is developed and tested on the following environment. While it may work on other systems, this is the supported configuration.

- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX series (developed on RTX 4070)
- **CUDA:** CUDA Toolkit 12.6
- **Compiler:** Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (with C++17 support)
- **Build System:** CMake 3.20+ & Ninja
- **Package Manager:** Git, vcpkg
- **Python:** Python 3.11+

## üöÄ Installation

The project uses a manual build process to ensure all C++ dependencies are correctly compiled and linked.

**Important:** All commands must be run from the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022**.

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iSFM.git
cd iSFM
```

#### 2. Install C++ Dependencies
This step uses `vcpkg` to automatically download and build all required C++ libraries (OpenCV+CUDA, Ceres, Eigen, etc.). This is a one-time setup and may take a significant amount of time (1-2 hours).
```bash
# This reads the vcpkg.json file and builds everything
vcpkg install
```

#### 3. Configure and Build C++ Code
This step configures the project with CMake and compiles the core C++ library and Python bindings using Ninja.
```bash
# Create and enter a build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure the project
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

# Compile the code
ninja
```

#### 4. Prepare for Python Installation
The compiled Python module (`.pyd` file) must be copied into the Python source directory before installation.
```bash
# From inside the 'build' directory:
# This copies and renames the compiled library to the correct location for packaging.
copy python\hybrid_sfm\hybrid_sfm._core.cp312-win_amd64.pyd ..\python\hybrid_sfm\_core.pyd /Y
```

#### 5. Install the Python Package
Finally, install the project as a Python package. This command is fast as it doesn't recompile any C++ code.
```bash
# Go back to the project's root directory
cd ..

# Install the package
pip install .
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

Once installed, you can use the `hybrid_sfm` package in your Python scripts. The core data structures are implemented in C++ for performance.

Note that Eigen-based vectors like `Point2D` are handled via NumPy for safety and performance.

```python
import numpy as np
import hybrid_sfm

# --- Create core objects ---
camera = hybrid_sfm.Camera()
camera.fx = 800.0

image = hybrid_sfm.Image()
image.id = 1

# --- Use NumPy for points ---
# This is the safe way to interact with Eigen types in C++
numpy_point = np.array([1024.5, 768.0], dtype=np.float64)

# Assign the NumPy array to a C++ member.
# pybind11 handles the conversion automatically.
observation = hybrid_sfm.Observation()
observation.feature_id = 42
observation.point = numpy_point

print("Created Observation object successfully!")
print(f"Retrieved point from C++ object: {observation.point}")
```

## üîß Development Workflow

After making any changes to the C++ source code (`.h` or `.cpp` files), you must recompile to make the changes available in Python. A utility script is provided for this.

1. Open the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022**.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory (`E:\dev\iSFM`).
3. Run the recompile script:
   ```bash
   recompile.bat
   ```
This script will automatically run `ninja`, copy the new `.pyd` file, and update the `pip` installation.
